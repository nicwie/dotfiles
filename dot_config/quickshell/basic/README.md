# General

This was mostly possible thanks to the very good quickshell documentation and [Caelestia shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) examples :)

## Requirements

- bat
- head
- iwctl

## TODO

- [ ] check for bat or cat and set accordingly
- [ ] Add Networkmanager, not only iw support
